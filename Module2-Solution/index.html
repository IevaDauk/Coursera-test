			<h2 class="color1">Sunny</h2>
			<p>The sort of weather where the skies are blue, the grass is bright, and there is lots of sunlight! It is generally warmer when the sun is out, so people in colder climates find it quite pleasant. People located in hotter climates may not be so fond of it.</p>

			<h2 class="color2">Rainy</h2>
			<p>The sort of weather where sky is dark and cloudy, usually sun cannot be seen, it is raining or even pouring. Storms can be a part of a rainy weather. A rainy day can also be "time of need or trouble", that everyone faces at some point of their lives. </p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2 class="color3">Cloudy</h2>
			<p>When the sky is cloudy, it's so full of clouds that you can't see the sun. A cloudy day isn't ideal for a trip to the beach, and a cloudy night isn't great for star gazing. You can also describe an issue, thought, or memory as cloudy when it's vague or half-remembered or unclear.</p>
